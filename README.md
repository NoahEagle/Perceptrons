# Perceptrons
Creates a binary perceptron (for binary classification) and a multi-class perceptron (for distinguishing between an arbitrary number of classes). It then uses these perceptrons to train on various datasets (while choosing relevant features and potentially augmenting the data) and classify new test data points accordingly.
